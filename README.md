## Overview

This directory contains concise notes and code samples for core CS50 data structures and algorithms, including arrays, lists, stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, and sorting/searching algorithms. Each subdirectory contains detailed explanations and code for the relevant topic.

## Contents

- **Arrays & Lists**  
  See [ds/Ds.md](cs50/ds/Ds.md) for a deep dive into Python lists vs arrays, memory layout, mutability, and performance.

  - Dynamic resizing, O(1) amortized append, and memory references are explained.
  - Includes code for stack and queue implementations using lists and `collections.deque`.

- **Linked Lists**  
  See [ds/linkedlists.md](cs50/ds/linkedlists.md) for an overview of linked lists, their memory model, performance, and Python's `collections.deque` as a linked list implementation.

- **Trees**  
  See [ds/Trees.md](cs50/ds/Trees.md) for binary tree properties, traversal algorithms (DFS, BFS), and time complexity.

  - Includes code for tree construction and traversal in [ds/trees.py](cs50/ds/trees.py).

- **Sorting & Searching Algorithms**  
  See [algorithms/sortings_alg.py](cs50/algorithms/sortings_alg.py) for implementations of merge sort, bubble sort, selection sort, binary search, and recursion examples (fibonacci, factorial).

- **Memory & Object Identity**  
  See [memory/mem.md](cs50/memory/mem.md) for details on Python's memory management, object identity, integer interning, and best practices for equality vs identity checks.
